/*
This code provides a full front-end React application for a responsive notes app.


Polish & UX considerations implemented:
- Cards have soft shadows and hover lift
- Modal has backdrop and smooth transitions (handled by Tailwind classes and CSS)
- Floating Add button and top Add button for convenience
- Category filter & search
- Duplicates detection and auto append numbering when creating a note with same title in same category
- LocalStorage persistence


Tips to improve further:
- Add rich-text editor for description (e.g. TipTap/Quill)
- Add image attachments storing as base64 or using cloud storage
- Add encryption for private notes
- Add drag to reorder or pinning notes
